[0.00 - 5.36]  This is the exact moment where we lost their powers of the other 5 elements in the weathering waves.
[5.36 - 9.84]  Let's write our protagonist actually had their full power when entering Staloris 3
[9.84 - 13.40]  for a matter of seconds before they were lost to the Synodians.
[13.40 - 15.58]  But for those who don't know, here's the rundown.
[15.58 - 20.04]  Resonance is a real concept that weathering waves uses to explain resonators.
[20.04 - 26.12]  You get your average value of homey and you have the remnant frequency of any random object or element.
[26.36 - 31.80]  This frequency is the same as the logo in light whenever you pick up an echo and in some cutscenes.
[31.80 - 36.52]  When these two have the same frequency, so in other words they pause the vibe check, they resonate.
[36.52 - 42.72]  So when robot dive bombs into the water, and their hand glows, the frequencies of their power lift the body.
[42.72 - 46.92]  Concerns are total of 5 particles, one for each element robot does not have.
[46.92 - 52.00]  One goes to the Dreamless, which we retrieve, one towards Black Shores and three of Scream.
